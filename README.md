## Comments

I had a lot of fun doing this test, I found it very entertaining and interesting because it was an excuse to test web components that I found interesting in this kind of web, but at the same time it delayed me in some aspects of the development.

I know I could have done more and I have room for improvement but with the time I have been able to dedicate to it I feel proud of the result.
